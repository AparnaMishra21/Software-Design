For the purposes of this assignment, you will be developing a generic surbey/test taking system. The system is to be written in JAVA. 
The following system requirements must be met.

1. Develop a system that allows a survey/test to be entered, modified, stored, loaded, taken and tabulated/graded. The survey should be 
   stored in a file system, you may use an XML or a binary format, but do not have to. Each survey should be stored in an individual file.
   
2. A survey/test can be comprised of any combination of: True/False, Mulitple Choice, Short Answer, Essay Answer, Matching and Rank the choices.
   Each question can accept a single answer, or if, appropriate, multiple answers. Obviously, a True/False question would not accept multiple 
   answers.
   
3. Each test question, aside from the essays should have some sort of correct answer. This implies that each question can therefore be graded.

4. A result module should be developed that indicates the totals for a particular survey or test.
